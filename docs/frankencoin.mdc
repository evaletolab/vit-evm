# Frankencoin (ZCHF) — Summary for ViT

Source: [Frankencoin website](https://www.frankencoin.com/)

## What it is
- **Frankencoin (ZCHF)** is a Swiss franc (CHF) stablecoin implemented as an **ERC‑20**.
- The system is designed to be **collateralized and oracle‑free** (price discovery/liquidation is handled by market mechanisms rather than external price oracles).

## Core user use-cases (as presented by Frankencoin)
- **Pay**: use ZCHF for payments (send/receive, bills, salaries).
- **Borrow / Mint**: users can deposit collateral and mint ZCHF, then repay to unlock collateral.
- **Earn**: users can earn yield on ZCHF through the system’s savings products.

## Tokens and products
- **ZCHF (Frankencoin)**: ERC‑20 stablecoin tracking CHF.
- **FPS (Frankencoin Pool Shares)**: ERC‑20 governance/equity-style token representing a share in the reserve pool.
  - FPS is minted/redeemed against the reserve pool with fees and a **minimum holding period** before redemption.
- **Savings Vault**: an **ERC‑4626** vault implementation for ZCHF savings (ERC‑20 vault token).

## System mechanics (high-level)
- A minter deposits collateral and **mints ZCHF**, pays a fee into an equity reserve pool, sells ZCHF in the market.
- Users can **buy and spend** ZCHF.
- Savers can **lock ZCHF** into a savings vault to earn yield funded by the reserve pool.
- Investors can **mint/buy FPS** by adding capital to the reserve pool; after a minimum duration they can redeem back from the pool (subject to fees and pool performance).

## Implications for ViT MVP
- ViT can treat **ZCHF as the primary payment token** (instead of “xCHF”) on supported L2s like **Optimism** and **Arbitrum**.
- “Earn” can be modeled as an **ERC‑4626 deposit/withdraw** flow (initially on **Gnosis**, per the site).
- FPS is a **separate investment/governance token**; integrating it is optional for MVP and fits better in Phase 2.
